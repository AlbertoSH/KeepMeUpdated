# Keep me updated

Just a little example of how to stay updated when some data change

## What is it doing?

Once you subscribe to `personRepositoryRead` you'll never miss a thing.
You'll be noticed whith the new state when a new person is created, 
updated or deleted

## How is it doing it?

All repos have an `ItemChanges` object that propagates the changes
So all the have to do is respond suitably to them


BTW this is my first project with Kotlin and RxJava 2 so don't take this
as the bible. It's just an example

Stay kiwi!
